## 👋 Hi there, I’m Jamal 👨🏾‍💻

I'm a **product-focused full stack engineer** who lives and breathes code.

💡 Currently exploring:  
- ⚙️ System Architecture  
- 🧩 Design Patterns  
- 📐 SOLID Principles  

I love building things from scratch, optimizing performance, and bridging the gap between **technical complexity and real-world impact**.

### 🛠 Tech I enjoy
`TypeScript` • `Angular` • `NestJS` • `Node.js` • `PostgreSQL` • `Docker` • `Monorepos` • `React` 
Recently diving deeper into architecture, testing, and DevOps workflows.

### 🤝 Let’s connect
I love chatting about software, systems, and scaling products.  
Open to collaboration, pair programming, or just nerding out.
